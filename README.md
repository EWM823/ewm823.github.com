Frogger Part 1 and 2
Written By: Emmett Moore

PART A

To my knowledge, all aspects are working correctly.
I used W3 schools to learn about javascript objects
i spent about 3 hours on this

PART B

to my knowledge, every aspect of this projects works correctly

All basic requirements are fulfilled and the three extra implementations
I chose were the fly, level progression, and the audio. (for some reason it
wont work in chrome).

I am aware that my code is very messy... I reached a point of no return, and
if I could redo it, i would extensively use objects instead of arrays as
well as make functions more modular. I apologize to the grader.

I worked with Ian Cross and Gabe Joseph on this project.

I spent about 15 hours on this project
