JavaScript Notes:

With just HTTP, HTML, and CSS,
    * the content is STATIC--it cannot be changed.
    * no data can be persistent
    * No means of storing user's data between requests
    --> HTTP is a stateless protocol.
    * No info, including status about user, status codes, are ever retained.

Client-Side Programming / Development
    * Get info about a user's computer
    * Download data from a web server
    * Update only certain parts of an HTML document
    * Calculations
    * Render graphics on the body of a web page
    * Redirect users to another web page (on another domain)
    * Store data for a user
    * Allow new methods of user interaction (e.g., animations)
    * Get history of web pages visited

    JavaScript IS NOT Java
    JavaScript IS NOT a second-class citizen
    JavaScript IS NOT compuled (well, for Comp 20 at least)
    
Similiarities between JavaScript and C/C++
    * Commenting
    * For the most part, syntax and keywords
    * Style (use of {} [])
    * The usual stuff like operators and operands.

Key Concepts:
    1. Variables
    2. Functions
    3. Objects

Functions:
    * Return type is not specified
    * Parameters

/* Function in C */
double average(double num1, double num2){
return (num1+num2)/2;
}

/* Function in JavaScript */
function average(num1, num2)
{
    return (num1 + num2) / 2;
}

result = average(2); /* This is legal */
                
result = average(2, 3, "Batman"); /* This is also legal */
                                  /* Extra arguments are thrown out */
